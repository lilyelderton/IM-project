This is my lab book.

7/10/22: Today I had my first proper meeting with Emma and Alice. I learnt how to connect my project to github, which I am excited to use as it sounds very useful for keeping track of the changes i make to mny project. The plan for the week ahead is to try and read full pubmed articles into R that can then be used for analysis. I am apprehenisve about this because i have tried briefly before and google wasn't helpful. I am still trying to adjust from learning R with clear instructions (like previous years) to learning through my own exploration. We were given an example using the fulltext package, so hopefully this will help me.

10/10/22 - 12/10/22: I have been trying to use fulltext to read in full articles from pubmed into R but I haven't had much luck. It is much harder than I thought to follow someone else's work when there isn't clear explanation as to why each step was taken. I got very frustrated and wanted to give up, but I decided to practice some other skills instead so that i didn't get dejected with R overall - I needed the confidence that comes with getting something right. Thus, I read in some other files and practiced tidying them following along the example articles. This restored my confidence to try again on reading in my own work tomorrow. I will try to read in just the abstracts at first since there are a few packages for this that seem easier to use, and I will talk with Emma about reading in the full text on Friday in our meeting. 

13/10/22: Tried a few packages to read in the abstracts from R. Lots of trial and error which was frustrating - even though i do feel accomplished when i finally figure out how it works. I managed to get as far as reading in the text (using RISmed - http://amunategui.github.io/pubmed-query/) and then tokenise the abstracts. Plan is to then practice some analysis on these abstracts.

14/10/22: Had a meeting with Emma. We worked through all the problems I'd had in my script and managed to fix most of them! It was nice just having another brain to help find where I went wrong as this can sometimes be hard to do alone - you get stuck on one path looking for a solution and then just end up frustrated. I left the meeting feeling much more confident in where I was at with my project - a result of fixing the problems and knowing i was doing enougb work (something i had been worried about). I think in future I need to try contacting Emma or Alice more often to help if I'm stuck as I do enjoy the team work/having a support network when it comes to R. I then came home and managed to fix the problem of keeping hyphenated words together myself, and then performed some simple analysis. In the next week, I would like to try topic modelling - Emma recommended it as a method that would be good in the project - and look into litsearchR as another package that I could use in my project. 

18/10/22: I practiced tf-idf and started on topic modeling for my practice dataset. Most of this went smoothly and so has built my confidence in using R. 

19/10/22: Finished topic modeling for my dataset. Had to troubleshoot in a few places, but this did not take too long - my R problem solving is improving with practice. Topic modeling in this way didn't seem too suited to my dataset however - I think either the search was too narrow to divide into topics, or their were too many confounding terms (a lot of numbers?). I will discuss this with Emma at my meeting on Friday. Next I would like to look into litsearchR as a package. 

21/10/22: Today I practiced using litsearchR to assess the keywords associated with a pubmed search, and then using these to create a new search that should encompass the topic more effectively. The instructions were very clear to follow and so everything ran smoothly. I think that this package could be very useful in my project to assess whether keywords have changed over time as the PNI moves into IP, although I think the creating a new search tool may be harder to use - the results from those searches are massive making them too large to read into R. 
I also had a short meeting with Emma. I had no problems to talk about this week so the meeting didn't feel very useful to me. In future I think I will plan out more of what I want to cover in these meetings so I can get the most out of them, as I don't enjoy feeling directionless. She did recommend making a full plan for my literature review that she can look over, so I will do this, as well as trying to make a comprehensive plan for the analysis i'd like to do for my project that I can show her next week.
