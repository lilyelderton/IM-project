This is my lab book.

7/10/22: Today I had my first proper meeting with Emma and Alice. I learnt how to connect my project to github, which I am excited to use as it sounds very useful for keeping track of the changes i make to mny project. The plan for the week ahead is to try and read full pubmed articles into R that can then be used for analysis. I am apprehenisve about this because i have tried briefly before and google wasn't helpful. I am still trying to adjust from learning R with clear instructions (like previous years) to learning through my own exploration. We were given an example using the fulltext package, so hopefully this will help me.

10/10/22 - 12/10/22: I have been trying to use fulltext to read in full articles from pubmed into R but I haven't had much luck. It is much harder than I thought to follow someone else's work when there isn't clear explanation as to why each step was taken. I got very frustrated and wanted to give up, but I decided to practice some other skills instead so that i didn't get dejected with R overall - I needed the confidence that comes with getting something right. Thus, I read in some other files and practiced tidying them following along the example articles. This restored my confidence to try again on reading in my own work tomorrow. I will try to read in just the abstracts at first since there are a few packages for this that seem easier to use, and I will talk with Emma about reading in the full text on Friday in our meeting. 

13/10/22: Tried a few packages to read in the abstracts from R. Lots of trial and error which was frustrating - even though i do feel accomplished when i finally figure out how it works. I managed to get as far as reading in the text (using RISmed - http://amunategui.github.io/pubmed-query/) and then tokenise the abstracts. Plan is to then practice some analysis on these abstracts.
